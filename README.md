AssemblaPHP
=====

This is an experimental approach to wrapping the Assembla API into a PHP "ORM". Use it to easily pull tickets, milestones, users, and more from your Assembla Space. You may consumer this as a Composer package or experiment with the `www` folder for a sandbox on a Bootstrap based ticket list.
